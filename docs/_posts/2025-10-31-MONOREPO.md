# The MONOREPO experiment

Im testing a [MONOREPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) because Phil said this was a bad idea. To that i say hold my beer.

In all seriousness, I Think that for a small dev team/solo dev. The simplicity is worth higher barer to entry. One of my most annoying processes was updating my system tools. I had to build my update in a feature branch and then merge it into my main branch. then go to my dotfiles create a feature branch update the system tools merge it into main.

It will be starting with my Nix Dotfiles Python tools and now my blog.

I will be reaching ot to phil on 2030-10-31 and 2035-10-31 to give him updates on the progress.

Known Issues:

- the python tests are running on the current derivation not the one the derivation im updating to.
